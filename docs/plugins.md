# Plugins

Cerebro plugin is just a javascript module. All you need is to write a function, that takes one object and call a function from arguments with your results.

> You should have installed node and npm. If you don't have it: follow [this](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) instructions.

You can create your plugin [from scratch](./plugins/from-scratch.md), but I'd suggest you to use [boilerplate](./plugins/boilerplate.md). In this case you can focus on source of your plugin, not on tools around it.
